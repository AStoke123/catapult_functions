# Password Checker Assignment

Welcome to the **Password Checker** assignment! In this project, you'll practice writing JavaScript functions and connecting them to a web page. Your goal is to make a simple password checker that shows a fun message if the password is correct.

## What You'll Learn
- How to write a JavaScript function
- How to use `if` statements
- How to connect your function to a button click
- How to show and hide messages on a web page

## Getting Started
1. **Open the project folder** in VS Code. You should see these files:
    - `index.html` (the web page)
    - `script.js` (where you'll write your code)
    - `style.css` (for styling)

2. **Open `script.js`**. This is where you'll write your JavaScript code.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

### 1. Write the Password Checking Function
- Find the comment that says:
  ```js
  // 1 - Write your function here
  ```
- Write a function that takes a password as input and returns `true` if the password is correct, or `false` if it is not.

### 2. Use Your Function When the Button is Clicked
- Find the comment that says:
  ```js
  // 2 - Call your function here, store the result in a variable
  ```
- Call your function with the password from the input box.
- Use the result to display the correct message

### 3. Test Your Work
- Open `index.html` in your browser (you can use the Live Server extension or just double-click the file).
- Try entering the correct password and clicking the button. You should see the success message
- Try entering a wrong password. You should see the denied message
